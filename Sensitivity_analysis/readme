Sensitivity analyses

We varied the maximum lag time from 14 to 13, 15, or 16 days for wildfire-related PM2.5; 
changed the degrees of freedom of lag days (from 4 to 3 or 5) in the cross-basis function; 
also changed the df of meteorological variables (from 3 to 4 or 5) and the moving average days of temperature (from 21-day to 14-day). 

Results were presented in Table S1.
